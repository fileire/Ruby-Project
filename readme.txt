Step 1: Fork the "directory/folder" repo
Step 2: Clone your fork
You've successfully forked the "directory/folder" repo, but so far it only exists on GitHub. To be able to work on the project,
you will need to clone it to your local machine.

Run the following code:

git clone https://github.com/username/<name_of_repository>.git
# Clones your fork of the repo into the current directory in terminal
